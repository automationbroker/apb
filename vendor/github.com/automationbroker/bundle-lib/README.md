## Bundle Library

This is a library to facilitate running service bundles in a k8s/openshift cluster. This is meant to be used by the [automation broker](https://github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker) to expose this functionality to the OSB API.

### THIS IS A BETA VERSION
This is under active development and has no backward compatibility guarantees.
