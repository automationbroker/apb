## Go Client for the Broker

The go client for the broker is a [generated](https://github.com/kubernetes/code-generator) client for the [automation broker](https://github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker). These are the types that the broker will use internally to store data. This client should function and behave similar to other k8s generated clients.
